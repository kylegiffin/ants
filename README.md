#In this project, we created a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees. As the ant queen, the player populates their own colony with the bravest ants one can muster. These ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade the player's territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies.

#This project combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms, focusing on the material from Chapter 2.5 of Composing Programs. The project also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program.
